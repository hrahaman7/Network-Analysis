# Network-Analysis

Network analysis in unsupervised learning is a method of using data structures such as graphs and networks to discover patterns and relationships in data without predefined labels. This can be useful in many areas, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and more.

In unsupervised learning, network analysis can involve techniques such as clustering, community detection, and centrality measures. Let’s go through an example project that demonstrates how you can use unsupervised learning and network analysis together.

Example Project: Community Detection in a Social Network
In this example, we'll focus on detecting communities within a social network using network analysis and unsupervised learning. We'll use the NetworkX library in Python to create and analyze a graph representing a social network.

Project Outline:
1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for graph analysis and visualization.
2. Load Data: Load social network data into a graph.
3. Visualize the Network: Plot the graph to understand its structure.
4. Community Detection: Use an unsupervised learning algorithm to detect communities in the network.
5. Analyze Communities: Examine the detected communities and calculate their centrality measures.
6. Visualize Communities: Plot the network with nodes colored based on their community.

Project Steps:
Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries like NetworkX for graph analysis and Matplotlib for visualization.
Load Data: Load the social network data. In the example, the data is loaded using NetworkX’s karate_club_graph() function.
Visualize the Network: Plot the graph to visualize the network.
Community Detection: Use an unsupervised learning algorithm, such as the greedy modularity algorithm, to detect communities in the network.
Analyze Communities: Examine the detected communities by printing out each community and the nodes in it.
Visualize Communities: Plot the graph with nodes colored based on their community. This helps visualize the community structure in the network.
Conclusion:
This is a simple example of network analysis in unsupervised learning, focusing on community detection within a social network. In more complex projects, you could explore different graph data structures, algorithms, and additional metrics to analyze different types of networks.
